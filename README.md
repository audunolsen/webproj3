## 1. Objectives
Students should be able to design, implement, and deliver complete web solutions by work- ing in groups.

## 2. Description
In this assignment, you are expected to design and implement a complete web solution for searching text documents. The solution will require you to setup and configure an Apache Solr search engine and to implement a search interface on top of it for end users.

The use case will be based on PTIL’s (Petroleum Safety Authority Norway) archives. PTIL is an independent government regulator with responsibility for safety, emergency preparedness and the working environment in the Norwegian petroleum industry. PTIL publishes reports such as audit and investigation as PDF files through its website.

The search application should allow searching within the PDF files itself and their metadata (e.g., operator, year, responsible, and summary). The application should allow AND, OR, and MINUS search, highlight the keywords in the returned results, match search keywords in al- ternative forms (i.e., root of the word, singular, without possessive, and synonyms), and do faceting on categorical data (e.g., like in finn.no, for example on year, type etc.). Finally, it should be possible to update metadata values through the application.

**Deadline: 12 Dec. 2017 23:59**
